rippled-spec
============

The `rippled` API specification defined in `JSON`.

These files can be used by developers to programmatically generate or validate transactions and API method calls.

## API

API specification can be loaded from [`spec/api.json`](spec/transactions.json).

## Transactions

The transaction spec defines transaction types and their field detail.

The transaction specification can be loaded from [`spec/transactions.json`](spec/transactions.json).

Some transaction types have a `flag` property. When set, these values can be loaded from [`spec/flags.json`](spec/flags.json).

## Transaction Type Validation

Validation can occur at the transaction type level, or the field level.

A `validation` property will occur at either level when appropriate.

### Field Level Validations

Validations for field types like `Unsigned Integer` are not explicitly defined.

- `allow_zero`: Fields may require values be within a range above 0, when also accepting 0.
- `allowed`: An array of allowed values.
- `min`: Minimum value allowed.
- `max`: Maximum value allowed.
- `regex`: Regular expression for string formats.

### Transaction Type Level Validations

There are cases where a field is required or not allowed based on another one being defined. This is where group
validation comes into play.

Group types:
- `dependent`: If one of the fields in the group is defined, then the rest are required.
- `exclusive`: Only one of the fields is allowed. If `required` is set, then at least one of them is required.
- `required`: At least one of the fields are required.

## Limitations

There are validations (at least with Escrow) which have not yet been worked out to be defined in JSON format.

For example, with `EscrowCreate`, if both `CancelAfter` and `FinishAfter` are defined, then `FinishAfter` must be before 
`CancelAfter`.
